![by Matt Benson](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/squidmedia/gfexcel/master/assets/banner-772x250.jpg)

Get realtime entries from your forms using a unique and secure URL. No need to login, or create a user account for
that one person who needs the results. Just copy the URL, and give it to the person who needs it. It's that simple.

You can export to `.xlsx` or `.csv`.

## Export Gravity Forms entries to Excel

Using Gravity Forms you can always export a CSV file, and import it to Excel. But an admin always needs to be involved
and using Excel to import a CSV is a pain.

The plugin also has a few plugin hooks to make your excel output exactly how you want it. Check out the FAQ to find
out more.

### Requirements

* PHP 7.1 or higher
* `php-xml` and `php-zip` libraries.
* Gravity Forms 2.0 or higher
