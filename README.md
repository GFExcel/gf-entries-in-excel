# Gravity Forms Entries in Excel

Get realtime entries from your forms using a unique and secure url. No need to login, or create a user account for
that one person who needs te results. Just copy the url, and give it to the guy who needs it. It's that simple.

Using Gravity Forms you can always export a CSV file, and import it to Excel. But an admin always needs to be involved
and using Excel to import a CSV is a pain in the butt.

The plugin also has a few plugin hooks to make your excel output exactly how you want it. Check out the FAQ to find
out more.

### Requirements

* PHP 5.6 or higher (tested on PHP7 too)
* Gravity Forms 2.1.0
