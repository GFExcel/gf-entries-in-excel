# Gravity Forms Entries in Excel
![by Matt Benson](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/squidmedia/gfexcel/master/assets/banner-772x250.jpg)

Get realtime entries from your forms using a unique and secure url. No need to login, or create a user account for
that one person who needs te results. Just copy the url, and give it to the guy who needs it. It's that simple.

You can export to `.xlsx` or `.csv`.

## Export Gravity Forms entries to Excel
Using Gravity Forms you can always export a CSV file, and import it to Excel. But an admin always needs to be involved
and using Excel to import a CSV is a pain in the butt.

The plugin also has a few plugin hooks to make your excel output exactly how you want it. Check out the FAQ to find
out more.

### Requirements

* PHP 7.1 or higher
* `php-xml` and `php-zip` libraries.
* Gravity Forms 2.0 or higher

### Docs
I made a [Full documentation](http://gfexcel.doeken.org) site for you developers out there!  

### Like the plugin? Buy me a drink â˜•!
Do you find the plugin helpful? Cool, glad to hear! It's taken me a 'few hours' to create this plugin. 
It's free for all, but if you'd like, you can [buy me a drink](https://www.paypal.me/doekenorg). 
Being hydrated makes it easier to update the plugin. But no pressure!
